### TL;DR: DO NOT TOUCH IT

This code is mine. I wrote it, I debugged it, I stayed up too late making it work, and I bled for its elegance.  
You are **not** entitled to use it, train your bots on it, profit from it, or remix it into some Frankenstein abomination that ends up in a SaaS pitch deck.  
**Keep your hands, eyes, and scrapers off unless I say otherwise.**

## Legal Rights You Don’t Have

Unless I give you explicit, written permission, you may **NOT**:

- Copy it  
- Modify it  
- Distribute it  
- Sell it  
- Use it in a commercial product  
- Train AI/ML models with it  
- Include it in datasets, corpora, embeddings, or neural slurry  
- Fork it into a GitHub repo and slap your name on it  
- Reword it and pretend it’s different  
- Use it as part of “research” to make AI smarter  
- Run it in production  
- Rehost it, repackage it, or reference it in code generation tools  

**Basically: don’t.**

## What You *Can* Do

- Read it, locally, for educational purposes  
- Learn from it  
- Respect it  

That's it.  
No, “fair use” doesn't cover data scraping.  
No, you can’t just use a snippet.  
No, your “non-commercial academic project” isn’t exempt.

## AI-Specific Clause

To be crystal clear:

> This software may **not** be used, directly or indirectly, in the training, fine-tuning, evaluation, dataset creation, benchmarking, or inference of **any** machine learning model, AI system, LLM, neural network, or synthetic intelligence project of any kind.

If your project involves the words:

- “transformer”  
- “embedding”  
- “diffusion”  
- “GPT”  
- “data scraping”  

**—this code is off-limits.** No exceptions. Not even *“for research.”* Not even *“just metadata.”*  
**I’m watching you.**

## Legal Status

This is copyrighted intellectual property under U.S. and international law.  
No license is granted by default.  
Any unauthorized use constitutes infringement.

Yes, I can sue.  
Yes, I will.  
And yes, this document is admissible in court.

## Want Permission?

If you have a legitimate reason to use this code, write me directly. Make your case.

- If I say yes, we’ll put it in writing.  
- If I say no, that’s the end of it.

---

## Final Word

This code is not open source, not public domain, and **not yours**.

If you respect good code, you'll leave it alone or ask nicely.  
If you don’t, **I’ll find out.**
